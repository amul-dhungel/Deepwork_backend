AS a teacher\noften wonder who Is the teacher7\nSometimes | am on the brink\nof wringing my hands and clench-\ning my lip in disgust when |\nm unable to get some concept\nacross to my 43 pupils. But, at\nthat last minute-somehow spark\ncomes and they grasp the fact\nor solve the problem.\n\n\nWho was taught them was.\nSurely no teacher ever feels that\nhe or she has the magin formula\nto teach all pupils who face them\nfrom year to year. However, |\nbelieve that more children might\nlearn if the schools respected\ntheir willingness to learn bit\nmore.\n\n\nThere are thousands Of chill\ndren might learn If the schools\nrespected their willingness to\nlearn bit more.\n\n\nThere are thousands of chill\ndren who are unable to learn\nsimply because no one takes time\nto find their particular interest.\nNo one child may want to read the\nsame book. No one child may\nwant to draw at the same time\nas his classmates.\n\n\nOne day l opened up bag which\ncontained some oyster shells. My\nhusband had Toasted several\nnights before on the oysters.\nAS we opened them on the drain\nboard--I told him that | would\nkeep them for my class.\n\n\nNever suspecting that half\ndozen shells could stimulate so\nuch interest--I walked in with\nplittle brown bag.\n\n\nYou can not imagine the move\nant and conversation these low\nly shells caused. We handled\nthem we rubbed them. We\nsmelled them, we traced them and\nwe read about them. Encycloped-\nlas we're brought out. Science\ntextbooks and even magazines\nwe're located with shell pictures.\n\n\nThe next day several pupils\nbrought some shells from home\nand we had a grand time dis\ncovering the kinds Of animals\nthat lived in our oceans.\n\n\nDuring a trip to the Bahama\nIslands my husband had brought\na two shells. had never taken\ntime to learn what kind they we're.\nOne Of my pupils found a pic\nrure Of my shells In a nature\nstudy booklet.\n\n\nWith satisfaction on his face,\nhe rushed to my desk saying he\nhad found out about our mystery\nshells.\n\n\nWe may live far away from\nthe ocean, but somehow the ocean\nis very near.

We need\nmore ways to keep pupil atten-\ntion. Some need art, some need\nsinging, some need poetry. some\nneed phonics, some need history,\nsome need baseball, some need\nsewing and some need language.\n\n\nAll need just little more\nunderstanding and little more\nheading in the right direction.",

But, at\nthat last minute-somehow spark\ncomes and they grasp the fact\nor solve the problem.\n\n\nWho was taught them was.\nSurely no teacher ever feels that\nhe or she has the magin formula\nto teach all pupils who face them\nfrom year to year. However, |\nbelieve that more children might\nlearn if the schools respected\ntheir willingness to learn bit\nmore.\n\n\nThere are thousands Of chill\ndren might learn If the schools\nrespected their willingness to\nlearn bit more.\n\n\nThere are thousands of chill\ndren who are unable to learn\nsimply because no one takes time\nto find their particular interest.\nNo one child may want to read the\nsame book. No one child may\nwant to draw at the same time\nas his classmates.\n\n\nOne day l opened up bag which\ncontained some oyster shells. My\nhusband had Toasted several\nnights before on the oysters.\nAS we opened them on the drain\nboard--I told him that | would\nkeep them for my class.\n\n\nNever suspecting that half\ndozen shells could stimulate so\nuch interest--I walked in with\nplittle brown bag.\n\n\nYou can not imagine the move\nant and conversation these low\nly shells caused. We handled\nthem we rubbed them. We\nsmelled them, we traced them and\nwe read about them. Encycloped-\nlas we're brought out. Science\ntextbooks and even magazines\nwe're located with shell pictures.\n\n\nThe next day several pupils\nbrought some shells from home\nand we had a grand time dis\ncovering the kinds Of animals\nthat lived in our oceans.\n\n\nDuring a trip to the Bahama\nIslands my husband had brought\na two shells. had never taken\ntime to learn what kind they we're.\nOne Of my pupils found a pic\nrure Of my shells In a nature\nstudy booklet.\n\n\nWith satisfaction on his face,\nhe rushed to my desk saying he\nhad found out about our mystery\nshells.\n\n\nWe may live far away from\nthe ocean, but somehow the ocean\nis very near.

We need\nmore ways to keep pupil atten-\ntion.
