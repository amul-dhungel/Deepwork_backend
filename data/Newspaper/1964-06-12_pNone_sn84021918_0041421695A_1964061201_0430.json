To make a parody on the\nsometimes humorous televisiOn\nshow THAT Was the Week That\nWas. It shows promise of be-\ncoming either a very good pro-\ngram or turning into the worlds\nworst television vehicle of the\nyear.\n\n\nFamiliar phrases such as\nHey, have you heard this One?@\nand SPsst. come here let me tell\nyou a funny story, are mouthed\nby young and old from Maine\nto Hawaii.\n\n\nJoke writer's have garnered a\nniche in our culture and there\nare collections of time worn\nfables of Aesop to the latest\nedition of the Joe Miller group.\n\n\nNothing can ever take the place\nof a funny story. There may be\nmany different types of tranquil\nizers placed on the market, but\nnone can replace the pleasure of\nhumorous tale or cartoon.\n\n\nIn my early childhood can\nrecall some Of the funny things\nthat my Grandfather Harry, bet\nter known as Racker, would tell.\nHe always had ears for funny\nones and he kept us rolling with\nsome which he brought home.\n\n\nWhen he felt like shocking us\nhe would say, 4Watch out, this\none is a bit sooty.\" Racker was\nfull of stories that he picked\nup form the men at the coke\nand gas plant and later on the\ncity street cleaning truck. His\njob at the coal yard as night\nWaterman provided him with\nmany sad stories as we'll, during\nthe depression years.\n\n\nThe greatest clowns seem to\nhave a bit of pathos in them.\nRecall, the wistful appearance Of\nCharlie Chaplin, the wry wit of\nJoe Penner and the elflike CLEAN\nof Ed Wynn.\n\n\nEmmett Kelly, perhaps, one Of\nthe greatest modern day circus\nclowns, was habitually Oh the\nverge of tears.\n\n\nEven Red Skeletons characters\nbring a comic relief when the\nsituations are not funny.\n\n\nJackie GleaSon's Poor Soul\ncharacter brings a heart pulling\nsmile when he becomes involved\nin some incidents.\n\n\nThe masks of the theaters\nwhich display tragedy and comedy\nare closer related than one\nimagines. Some sad events are\nreally funny, but we have been\ntrained to see most of the heart\nbreak.\n\n\nWhat makes you smile, may\non the other hand, make someone\nelse weep. There is an old Per-\nsian proverb which says if joy\ncomes in the door, watch out\nbecause sorrow is under the\nbed.\n\n\nAS this week ends, remember\nthat a bit of humor keeps one\nnot only happier looking, but it\nimproves your mind. Once Tread\nthat it takes more facial muscles\nto frOWn than it does to laugh.\n\n\nUnfortunately today many CO.\nmedians especially on the night\nclub circuit feel that humOr must\nbe off color or really dirty.\nsometimes this philosophy\nreaches into our radio and tele-",

It shows promise of be-\ncoming either a very good pro-\ngram or turning into the worlds\nworst television vehicle of the\nyear.\n\n\nFamiliar phrases such as\nHey, have you heard this One?@\nand SPsst. come here let me tell\nyou a funny story, are mouthed\nby young and old from Maine\nto Hawaii.\n\n\nJoke writer's have garnered a\nniche in our culture and there\nare collections of time worn\nfables of Aesop to the latest\nedition of the Joe Miller group.\n\n\nNothing can ever take the place\nof a funny story. There may be\nmany different types of tranquil\nizers placed on the market, but\nnone can replace the pleasure of\nhumorous tale or cartoon.\n\n\nIn my early childhood can\nrecall some Of the funny things\nthat my Grandfather Harry, bet\nter known as Racker, would tell.\nHe always had ears for funny\nones and he kept us rolling with\nsome which he brought home.\n\n\nWhen he felt like shocking us\nhe would say, 4Watch out, this\none is a bit sooty.\" Racker was\nfull of stories that he picked\nup form the men at the coke\nand gas plant and later on the\ncity street cleaning truck.
