Our lives are on\na higher plane than ancient cave\nor cliff dwellers. but bas1cally\nour emotions are on the same\nlevel. After dinner we still en-\nJoy Dragging about the biggest\nfish, the biggest buck or the\nhighest bowling score. Husbands\nstill take pride in passing kind\nremarks concerning their wives\ncakes (even though Betty Croker\ngave them hand).\n\n\nHouses bear decorating\nschemes of more established men\nand women who don't paint ami\nmails on the walls, although some\nof their attempts resemble the\nzoos.\n\n\nNo Sphinx has been built in\nour era, but men of affluence\nstill make their indelible mark\nin other ways. They finance\nschools, theaters and hospitals.\nwhile working to benefit mankind.\n\n\nThe advent Of newspapers and\nmagazines forced advertising to\nbecome an integral part of our\nlives. Radio and teleMsion en-\ntrenched advertising as one Of\nthe big businesses Of the world.\n\n\nWe live in buyers and sell\nlers world. If you aren't selling\nyour pursestrings are open to\nmake a purchase. This inter-\nchange goes on constantly from\nthe cradle to the grave. A min\nlister is hoping to win converts\nto his particular fold.\n\n\nA teacher hopes to sell the\napark of learning in the class\nroom. The architect designs one\nmagnificent structure in order to\nwin more fame and fortune. A\nwriter pens his best novel in\nsearch of a reader or a place\non the top book list. A singer\ncuts a disc hoping 1t will win\ngolden platter.",
