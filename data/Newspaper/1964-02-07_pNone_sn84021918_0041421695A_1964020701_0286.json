There are strikes,\ndemonstrations, riots, fights,\nmassacres and other terrible\ndeeds occurring at home and\non foreign soil.\n\n\nOur diplomats have convinced\nthose who are in power to es-\ntablish shot line\" from Wash\nington DC. to Moscow. This pri-\nvate telephone service is con-\nnected directly from our presi-\ndent office to the Russian pre-\nmier's office. The line is sup\nposedly method to prevent hasty\ndecisions and save time routing\nInformation through our diplo-\nmatte corps.\n\n\nA couple of weeks ago some\nperson in Finland severed piece\nof the hot line connection. just\nimagine If there had been dra-\nmatte and urgent message to con-\nvey from Moscow to the White\nHoused Can't you see Lyndon\ndrawing to Nk1ta, \"Howdy, Nix\nXII, how ya'll been over there7\"\n\n\nBefore Nikita would have had\ntime to answer and get the pro-\nper translation back - the wire\nwould have been severed by an\nirate citizen or some irrespon-\nsible prankster.\n\n\nWe may marvel at man. at\ntempts to conquer space, but\nthere are many more gremlins\naround than the scientists dare to\nmention. They are constantly\npreparing for the unforeseen or the\nproblematic or the theoretical\nbut never, never should the human\nelement be overlooked.\n\n\nNo mention was made for the\nreason of the Firms action. He\nmerely cut the wire. Perhaps. he\nhad an unhappy childhood. Per-\nchance, his early days we're upset\nby the constant ringing of tele-\nphone. Maybe he was ignored by\nhis mother while she conversed\non the telephone.\n\n\nInstead of hot line there\nshould be in its place a hot\nparty line. Why have just one hot\nline to the Russians7 What about\na hot line with Great Britain,\nFrance, West and EastGermany,\nGreece, Liberia, New Zealand,\nBrazil and Antarctica7\n\n\nThis would give our men in\nthe White House ample instant\ncoverage of faraway places.\n\n\nThis hot party line would be\nconnected through some kind of\ndual control--no one station could\nbe interrupted by mere cutting\nof the wire. A satellite trans\nmitter would no doubt be useful.\n\n\nIn addition the hot line con-\nversations should be teleWsed\nvia the national hookups. Cities\nwithout teleWsion facilities could\nhear the phone calls on the ma\ntional radio broadcasts.\n\n\nThe international hot party line\nwould eliminate the vast intelli-\ngence and counter intelligence\ncorps which operate in all ma\ntions. This would also halt the\nneed for the hundreds of foreign\nambassadors, embassy officers\nand emissaries of good will who\ninhabit the cities across the four\ncorners Of the earth.\n\n\nAS the operation became bet\nter controlled there could be a\nline connected with all of the\nnations represented in the\nUnited Nations. We could save\nother thousands by providing all\nof our enemies, friends, neutral\nallies and our own citizens with\nfirsthand reports of our foreign",

There are strikes,\ndemonstrations, riots, fights,\nmassacres and other terrible\ndeeds occurring at home and\non foreign soil.\n\n\nOur diplomats have convinced\nthose who are in power to es-\ntablish shot line\" from Wash\nington DC. to Moscow. This pri-\nvate telephone service is con-\nnected directly from our presi-\ndent office to the Russian pre-\nmier's office. The line is sup\nposedly method to prevent hasty\ndecisions and save time routing\nInformation through our diplo-\nmatte corps.\n\n\nA couple of weeks ago some\nperson in Finland severed piece\nof the hot line connection. just\nimagine If there had been dra-\nmatte and urgent message to con-\nvey from Moscow to the White\nHoused Can't you see Lyndon\ndrawing to Nk1ta, \"Howdy, Nix\nXII, how ya'll been over there7\"\n\n\nBefore Nikita would have had\ntime to answer and get the pro-\nper translation back - the wire\nwould have been severed by an\nirate citizen or some irrespon-\nsible prankster.\n\n\nWe may marvel at man. at\ntempts to conquer space, but\nthere are many more gremlins\naround than the scientists dare to\nmention. They are constantly\npreparing for the unforeseen or the\nproblematic or the theoretical\nbut never, never should the human\nelement be overlooked.\n\n\nNo mention was made for the\nreason of the Firms action. He\nmerely cut the wire. Perhaps. he\nhad an unhappy childhood. Per-\nchance, his early days we're upset\nby the constant ringing of tele-\nphone. Maybe he was ignored by\nhis mother while she conversed\non the telephone.\n\n\nInstead of hot line there\nshould be in its place a hot\nparty line. Why have just one hot\nline to the Russians7 What about\na hot line with Great Britain,\nFrance, West and EastGermany,\nGreece, Liberia, New Zealand,\nBrazil and Antarctica7\n\n\nThis would give our men in\nthe White House ample instant\ncoverage of faraway places.\n\n\nThis hot party line would be\nconnected through some kind of\ndual control--no one station could\nbe interrupted by mere cutting\nof the wire. A satellite trans\nmitter would no doubt be useful.\n\n\nIn addition the hot line con-\nversations should be teleWsed\nvia the national hookups. Cities\nwithout teleWsion facilities could\nhear the phone calls on the ma\ntional radio broadcasts.\n\n\nThe international hot party line\nwould eliminate the vast intelli-\ngence and counter intelligence\ncorps which operate in all ma\ntions. This would also halt the\nneed for the hundreds of foreign\nambassadors, embassy officers\nand emissaries of good will who\ninhabit the cities across the four\ncorners Of the earth.\n\n\nAS the operation became bet\nter controlled there could be a\nline connected with all of the\nnations represented in the\nUnited Nations. We could save\nother thousands by providing all\nof our enemies, friends, neutral\nallies and our own citizens with\nfirsthand reports of our foreign",
