My resolution writing\nended when | reached number\ntwenty.\n\n\nThis year l have decided to\nforego all writing and just spend\nthe last few hours of 1868 think\ning.

We worked\nharder than ever and enjoyed\nevery minute of the labor of pro-\nducing a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nEdward and | travelled great\ndeal and we met many interest\ning persons. l like to see diff\nferent cities and meet different\npeople. No matter where you 60,\nyou will make new friends. We\nstrike up conversations on the\nplane, in taxis, in the elevator\nor in the hotel lobby. Some of\nthe people we met in 1868 have\nbecome close friends.

For a little\nlady over seventy, she certainly\nwas perky.\n\n\nMy husband told her we would\nvisit her in the summer of 1864\nand this made her happy. In spite\nof the great distance Ed is still\nat heart an Englishman. When\never he gets homesick and calls\nEngland, see a faraway gaze\nin his eyes. After talking with\nhis mother he often starts tell\ning me of his boyhood. In 1868\nwe made many more travel plans.\n1t was year of planning.\n\n\nHow else can one recall year.\nA year Is measured in days,\nweeks and months. All pass so\nquickly that unless we keep a\nhuge diary, we are unable to\nrecollect to many events.\n\n\nSo much happens each day until\n1t is extremely difficult to keep\none week in mind.
