Even the saga\nand epic tales of valiant men\nignore the exploits of the political\nfigure of that particular era.\n\n\nIn this period of transformation\nit comes. In this change from\nsummer to autumn it appears.\n1t rears its shape early in the\nsummer and rises to its fullness\nduring July and August at ma\ntional conventions. September\narrives and the CLEAN in the eyes\nof all dedicated men who have\nproclaimed themselves the\nchosen turn not toward Mecca,\nbut to the ballot box or voters\nbooth.\n\n\nSociologists have attempted to\nevaluate the political surround\nings of man. They have care\nfully put man in the social order\nand endowed him with certain\ndesires, including food. water,\nshelter. and a society to live\nwithin.\n\n\nOnce upon a time. long ago\nbefore man learned that he could\nvoice his opinion. A very strong\nman overcame the huge beast\nwhich had terrorized his village.\nAll other men gave him some\ngifts and a string of animal\nclaws and teeth we're strung\naround his neck to distinguish\nhim from the other men of the\nvillage.\n\n\nAll was we'll until younger\nand more virile man killed three\nbeasts. He gave some Of the\nteeth and claws to his brothers,\nwho met and formed his council.\nThus, began the first political\nparty under the guise Of brother\nly love.\n\n\nThe title of chief was passed\nfrom father to son or to his\nbrother if he had only mere girls.\nMore councils we're organized in\nthe same village. Finally, all of\nthe councils met and decided to\nform one, big happy council. Each\ncouncil would be unable to meet\nregularly and it was agreed that\none man would represent the\ncouncil in the big meeting.\n\n\nTo tell the representatives\nfrom the other village men, they\nwould wear more claws plus\nfeather band. They would look\nfor a sign from the wise man\nusually the politicking strong\nmans father in law. The wise\nman would draw mysterious pic\nlures. fall into frances, innovate\nweird dances and chant unknown\nphrases.\n\n\nAfter years of power and pres\ntige, the chief became weary Of\nhis own great council. Times\nwe're easy and there we're few\nbeasts to kill. The families had\nall stopped feuding and even the\nyoung men we're becoming fat and\ntame.\n\n\nThe wise man and the politician\nchief met secretly to devise a\nplan which would start war with\na nearby community. The plan\nsucceeded and the chief annexed\nthe next village. At last, several\nvillages we're under the control\nof those conniving men and their\ntrusted aides.\n\n\nNo longer did beasts invade the\nvillages and the chief had tokeep\nsome controversies brewing so\nthe council could meet and have\nproblems to discuss. Once a\nlesser chief disagreed and he\nwas ordered to leave the land.\nThe seller chief surprised the\ncouncil by uttering his refusal\nIL eoid HT o0 If UoiI vote me",
