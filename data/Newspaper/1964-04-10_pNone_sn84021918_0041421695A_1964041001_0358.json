Days\nwhich are SO important now will\nhave been forgotten. Events\nwhich we hold near and dear will\nbe less than the wisp of smoke\nwhich rises from a faraway CHM\nney.\n\n\nWhile browsing through his\ntorical summary in our bookcase,\nturned to several pages con-\ntanning notes on 1864. There we're\nrecorded events of three hundred\nyears past which we're startling.\n\n\nOur country which is such a\nworld power today was mere\nterritory being settled by people\nfrom France, England. Holland\nand Spain.\n\n\nNew France and New Neither\nlands had been duly organized.\nNew Netherlands stretched from\nConnecticut to the Delaware Ri\nvers. 1t included parts of Maine\noutward to Cape Cod.\n\n\nNew France was vast expanse\nof land including part Of Canada\nand most of the Central and some\nareas of the South.\n\n\nBefore 1864 ended the Dutch\nlost control of the New Neither\nlands and the English won con-\ntroll. England renamed the area\nNew York honoring the King\nJames brother, the Duke ofYork.\n\n\nJust for the record Fort Orange\nwhich held the area guards and\nsoldiers of the Dutch colony was\nrenamed Albany as the English\nmade haste to erase the Dutch\ntitles.\n\n\nThe city of New Amsterdam\nbecame New York and the start\nof a great urban center began.\n\n\nToday New York is probably\nthe greatest metropolitan area\nin the United States loops. my Los\nAngeles and San Francisco\nfriends are dissenting).\n\n\nAll roads lead to 1t. All routes\nof transportation can originate\nor terminate there.

Some item\nof little consequence at this mo-\nment will be remembered when\nall of our epitaphs have been\nworn away by winds and rains.\n\n\nThings which are prominent\nnow will have vanished. Days\nwhich are SO important now will\nhave been forgotten. Events\nwhich we hold near and dear will\nbe less than the wisp of smoke\nwhich rises from a faraway CHM\nney.\n\n\nWhile browsing through his\ntorical summary in our bookcase,\nturned to several pages con-\ntanning notes on 1864. There we're\nrecorded events of three hundred\nyears past which we're startling.\n\n\nOur country which is such a\nworld power today was mere\nterritory being settled by people\nfrom France, England. Holland\nand Spain.\n\n\nNew France and New Neither\nlands had been duly organized.\nNew Netherlands stretched from\nConnecticut to the Delaware Ri\nvers. 1t included parts of Maine\noutward to Cape Cod.\n\n\nNew France was vast expanse\nof land including part Of Canada\nand most of the Central and some\nareas of the South.\n\n\nBefore 1864 ended the Dutch\nlost control of the New Neither\nlands and the English won con-\ntroll. England renamed the area\nNew York honoring the King\nJames brother, the Duke ofYork.\n\n\nJust for the record Fort Orange\nwhich held the area guards and\nsoldiers of the Dutch colony was\nrenamed Albany as the English\nmade haste to erase the Dutch\ntitles.\n\n\nThe city of New Amsterdam\nbecame New York and the start\nof a great urban center began.\n\n\nToday New York is probably\nthe greatest metropolitan area\nin the United States loops. my Los\nAngeles and San Francisco\nfriends are dissenting).\n\n\nAll roads lead to 1t. All routes\nof transportation can originate\nor terminate there. Even though\nHollywood is the mecca for would\nbe film actors and actresses.\n\n\nNew York has a monopoly on\nlegitimate theaters and opera and\nbooks and novels and jazz bands\nand ballet and skyscrapers and\n. 0\n\n\nNew York is a wonderful town.\nAS the Worlds Fair fever grows\n= New York will again become\nthe main attraction not only for\nthe 8 millions who live there\nbut for 80 millions more who\nwill visit the fair.\n\n\nWhen the historical Summar-\nles of 1854 are studied l wonder\nwhat will New York be called7\nwonder what will be written\non a page or town about the great\ncity, Will todays newscast have\nthe item7 Will the gigantic fair\nbecome lost in the shuttle of the\npages Of timer\n\n\nAre the time capsules and his\ntory keeping vaults worth all Of\nour efforts7 Will the men of\nthree centuries in the future be\nable to decipher our language7\n\n\nMORAL-You can be sure\nno one will care one hundred.",
