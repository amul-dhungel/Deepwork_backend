Nor\nris was a candidate for COVER\nnor, he made serious charges\nInvolving the honesty, integrity\nand business judgment of Ari-\niona Public Service Company\nand its officers and directors.\nAfter his 1862 defeat, MIR. Norris\nlost interest in pressing those\ncharges to a hearing where he\nwould have been required to sub\nstantiate them. Now, in August\nof 1864, Mr.. Morris Is again a\ncandidate for governor and again\nhe attacks Arizona Public Service\nCompany and its officers and di-\nrectors.\n\n\n\"Arizona Public Service Com\npany will ask for an early public\nhearing at which MIR. Morris will\nfinally be required to come for\nward with evidence, If any he\nhas, to support these statements.\n\n\nOur company denies these\ncharges and states that they are\nwholly without foundation. On\nbehalf of our fine officers and\ndirectors and onally, re-\nsent the charges that have been\nmade\"",
