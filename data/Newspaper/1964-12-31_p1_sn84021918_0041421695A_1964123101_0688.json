The role has changed\nfrom a one man leader, or a one man inter-\nnlediary, to a broadening Of the role Of\nle0de YShib.\n\n\n1t is commonly believed that seUe7 raj per-\nsons Witlin the Negro community haze the\nmagic formula for Wop1bing with the total\ngroup. This belief is far from the truth,\nbe cause no fine or six persons can know the\nthinking of the masses. Usually, the IN\ntelle ctuals, however, are useful in CON-\nMUM eating with the majority group, since\nthey haze the facility NTH words. The genuine\nleader must be able to express the desires\nof the group.\n\n\nThe several seD-styled leaders, as well\nas those 1OhO haze earned the rights of\nleadership, are often jealous of the role\nwhich one or tho might happen to play at\nthe time. These persons seem to be I'M\n01UaYe of the fact that leadership is a many\nsided thing, that leadership today might we'll\nbe fOllO1Oe YShib tomorrow In fact, the t1OO\nroles are often complimentary.\n\n\nThe complaint is often made that Negroes\nare not together Negro leaders are not\ntogether. Why should these tVo segments\nbe together any more than the members\nOf other groups !?

The era of one\nleadership has been replaced by leadership\nfrom several persons. The base of leadership\nneeds to be byoadened to include many more\npersons pOho are qualified by experience\nand education to fiji this role.
