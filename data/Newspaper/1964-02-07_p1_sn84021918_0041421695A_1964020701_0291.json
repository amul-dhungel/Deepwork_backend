The\nvolatile, handsome artist has\n\"glorifed\" folk singing at night\nclubs, in motion pictures, on\nrecords, television, and on the\nartistically hallowed stage Of\nCarnegie Hall.\n\n\nThe First Century of Negro\nfreedom also saw that period OF\nculture, often referred to as\nthe \"Negro Renaissance\" which\nfiared in the middle twenties and\nduring which gifted figures\nemerged in art, letters and",

His\nSt. Louis Blues\" Memphis\nBlues\" and others became stand\nards for instrumentalists and vo-\ncalists even before his death, and\nmany renditions of these have\nbeen recorded by RCA Victor.\n\n\nAS the First Century of Negro\nfreedom moved forward, jazz, the\nblues and other forms of popular\nmusic continued to witness an\nunbroken line of outstanding\nNegro artists, many of whose\nperformances spanned a genera\nton or more. Ethel Waters, who\nlaunched a many-faceted career\nOf night club tours, recordings,\nmotion pictures, musical revues\nand dramatic roles, Florence\nMills, featured in Sissle and\nBlake's \"Shuffle Along\" revue,\nthe Mills Brothers, Buck and\nBubbles, Josephine Baker, Cab\nGalloway, and Fats Waller were\namong these. The combined tai\nents and genius Of Edward Ken\nnedy Duke\" Ellington have won\nfor him an indisputable place at\nthe head of this list.\n\n\nNew talents rose in phalan&\nto take up the strains of music\nthat had it's beginnings in the.\nrural South. By the close Of\n1862, Negro performers had been\nnamed for awards in fifteen OF\nthe categories cited by the Ma\ntional Academy of Recording\nArts and Sciences.\n\n\nOne of the most meteoric rises\nto stardom has been that of Har-\nry Belafonte, who turned from\nthe singing Of popular ballads to\ncreate new interest in work\nsongs and traditional folk melo-\ndies from the world over. The\nvolatile, handsome artist has\n\"glorifed\" folk singing at night\nclubs, in motion pictures, on\nrecords, television, and on the\nartistically hallowed stage Of\nCarnegie Hall.\n\n\nThe First Century of Negro\nfreedom also saw that period OF\nculture, often referred to as\nthe \"Negro Renaissance\" which\nfiared in the middle twenties and\nduring which gifted figures\nemerged in art, letters and",

They were later\nJoined by Muriel Smith, Anne\nBrown, Muriel Rain, Camilla\nWilliams and Lawrence Winters\nas well as by instrumentalists\nwho launched successful careers.\n\n\nThat the field of music has\nbeen won by Negroes is further\nevidenced by Mattiwilda Dobbs'\nappearances with La Scala, and\nAdele Addison and William War\nfields inspiring performances\nwith the New York Philhar-\nmonte.
