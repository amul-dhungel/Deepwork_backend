You are wrong.\nYou are right but the event which\nl believe had more influence on\nour lives today was the issuing Of\na patent for the first animated\nmotion pictures on August IL,\n1914\n\n\nA man mreme mbered and un-\nheralded by modern movie mo-\nguls was John Randolph Bray Of\nNew York. He gave movement\nto cartoons of dog, the first\nmovie was simply entitled, 1.-The\nDachshund'\n\n\nThere was no story and no\nhistoric action. 1t was simply\nfilm of Mr.. Bray sketching the\nwiener shaped canine.\n\n\nTuesday marked the fiftieth\nanniversary Of this new picture\ntechnique. There have been thou\nsands of films made since the\nfirst one, however, we have not\nproduced too much more as far\nas subject material.\n\n\nDogs, cats, bears, gorillas.\nand all kinds of animals have\nnear monopoly on the home and\ntheater screens. Animal car\ntoonists are todays nouveau rich\nin the realm of moneymakers\nfrom the reel and protector.\n\n\nEven the first maker Of the\nanimated cartoon had more AMI\nNAL attachments, his very name\nBRAY, denotes the sound Of\na donkey.\n\n\nFilmgoers and television view\ners have worried about the de-\nmise of Gable, Bogart, Monroe,\nHarlow, Greenstreet, w. c.\nFields, and LORE. We have\nbecome accustomed to new stars\nand starlets with humdrum names\nas Tippi, Tuesday, Rip, Nick,\njill and Susan Qet us not overlook\nHayley).\n\n\nStill holding on with tenacious\ngrip is Lassie, and Tarzan's\nchimpanzees. They have been\njoined by various Disney dogs\nand Mister Ed, the talking horse.\n\n\nA sure way to discover just\nhow great the impact of animals\nhas been--notice your next five\nteleWsion commercials. Two Of\nthem will surely be selling dog or\ncat chow. See how doggy or catty\nthe humans even act7\n\n\nTomorrow millionaire will\nnot be the person who makes the\nbetter mousetrap but 1t will be\nthe man who trains the swing\nINCEST mouse or develops the\nnext thriller starring a lovable\nskunk.\n\n\nThe country is no longer\nmerely going to the dogs.

You are wrong.\nYou are right but the event which\nl believe had more influence on\nour lives today was the issuing Of\na patent for the first animated\nmotion pictures on August IL,\n1914\n\n\nA man mreme mbered and un-\nheralded by modern movie mo-\nguls was John Randolph Bray Of\nNew York. He gave movement\nto cartoons of dog, the first\nmovie was simply entitled, 1.-The\nDachshund'\n\n\nThere was no story and no\nhistoric action. 1t was simply\nfilm of Mr.. Bray sketching the\nwiener shaped canine.\n\n\nTuesday marked the fiftieth\nanniversary Of this new picture\ntechnique. There have been thou\nsands of films made since the\nfirst one, however, we have not\nproduced too much more as far\nas subject material.\n\n\nDogs, cats, bears, gorillas.\nand all kinds of animals have\nnear monopoly on the home and\ntheater screens.

Two Of\nthem will surely be selling dog or\ncat chow. See how doggy or catty\nthe humans even act7\n\n\nTomorrow millionaire will\nnot be the person who makes the\nbetter mousetrap but 1t will be\nthe man who trains the swing\nINCEST mouse or develops the\nnext thriller starring a lovable\nskunk.\n\n\nThe country is no longer\nmerely going to the dogs.
