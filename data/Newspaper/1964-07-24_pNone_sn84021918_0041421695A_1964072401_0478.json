They have the\nyoung girls crying and squeal-\ning. The Beatles have started\nmania. Everyone has been af-\nfected one way or another.\n\n\nTheir appearances here caused\nmore excitement than the Eddie\nLiz-Dickie idyll. The policemen\nwere hardpressed at every city\nto restrain the femmes who want\ned to grab them. Frankly, can\nsee little that should appeal to\nthe femmes unless it is true\nthe lads look like they need moth\nering.\n\n\nAfter listening to some of their\nsongs. however, | must admit\ntheir renditions have wuick\ntempo which appeals to young\nbloods. The Beatles have\namassed several millions of that\ngreen stuff while rolling their\nlimpid orbs and singing their\nlong tresses-so who | am to say\nthat they aren't great7\n\n\nEnough about the two legged\nBeatles-we are plagued with the\nsmaller forms now. The beetles\ninvaded our home this June dur\ning the last week and they have\nrepealed all kinds of sprays and\npowders. The only sure way to\nstop one is to step on it.\n\n\nThe pest control man said the\nValley was having an invasion Of\nbeetles and this type Is called\ndarling. fail to see any humor\nin calling a BEETLE darling. Per-\nhaps, the scientist who named\nthe species wanted to call it\nthe opposite of darling and his\nsuperiors refused to include his\nlabel in the list.\n\n\nThe darling beetles crawl up\nthe walls, they find their way in\nthe house when dusk approaches.\nThey flee to the outer walls of\nthe house when sprinkle the lawn\nor wash the driveway.\n\n\nGetting very disguised one day,\npurchased can of insect spray\nand sprayed in all the cracks and\ncrevices | could find. The next\nevening more beetles appeared.\nl seemed to be the only being\nsuffering from the effects Of the\nspray.\n\n\nThere we're a few crickets this\nsummer but few in comparison\nwith previous seasons. A grayish\ninsect called the sour bug &C\ncompanied the beetles, but they\nwe're promptly killed by the two\napplications from the pest con-\ntroll guns.\n\n\n| have thought of new way\nto rid the Valley of the Sun\nof the BEETLES. Let's wire the\nhuman Beatles and invite them\nto present concerts on the four\nsides of the city and see if the\nbeetles will run into the irriga-\nton waste canals.\n\n\n1t would be new twist to the old\nstory of the Pied Piper of Hame-\nlin. Then those Beatles could\nrave about the way they sent those\ncrazy, wild darling beetles.\n\n\nWonder who could foot the\nBeatles' bill7",

            "article": "During the past year a new\nquartet of long hairedyoung Eng\nlishmen have invaded the musical\nworld of the good old U.S.A.\nThey have usurped the sovereign\nterritory Of Elvis, Frankie,\nChubby and Bobby. They have the\nyoung girls crying and squeal-\ning. The Beatles have started\nmania. Everyone has been af-\nfected one way or another.\n\n\nTheir appearances here caused\nmore excitement than the Eddie\nLiz-Dickie idyll. The policemen\nwere hardpressed at every city\nto restrain the femmes who want\ned to grab them. Frankly, can\nsee little that should appeal to\nthe femmes unless it is true\nthe lads look like they need moth\nering.\n\n\nAfter listening to some of their\nsongs. however, | must admit\ntheir renditions have wuick\ntempo which appeals to young\nbloods. The Beatles have\namassed several millions of that\ngreen stuff while rolling their\nlimpid orbs and singing their\nlong tresses-so who | am to say\nthat they aren't great7\n\n\nEnough about the two legged\nBeatles-we are plagued with the\nsmaller forms now. The beetles\ninvaded our home this June dur\ning the last week and they have\nrepealed all kinds of sprays and\npowders. The only sure way to\nstop one is to step on it.\n\n\nThe pest control man said the\nValley was having an invasion Of\nbeetles and this type Is called\ndarling. fail to see any humor\nin calling a BEETLE darling. Per-\nhaps, the scientist who named\nthe species wanted to call it\nthe opposite of darling and his\nsuperiors refused to include his\nlabel in the list.\n\n\nThe darling beetles crawl up\nthe walls, they find their way in\nthe house when dusk approaches.\nThey flee to the outer walls of\nthe house when sprinkle the lawn\nor wash the driveway.\n\n\nGetting very disguised one day,\npurchased can of insect spray\nand sprayed in all the cracks and\ncrevices | could find. The next\nevening more beetles appeared.\nl seemed to be the only being\nsuffering from the effects Of the\nspray.\n\n\nThere we're a few crickets this\nsummer but few in comparison\nwith previous seasons. A grayish\ninsect called the sour bug &C\ncompanied the beetles, but they\nwe're promptly killed by the two\napplications from the pest con-\ntroll guns.\n\n\n| have thought of new way\nto rid the Valley of the Sun\nof the BEETLES. Let's wire the\nhuman Beatles and invite them\nto present concerts on the four\nsides of the city and see if the\nbeetles will run into the irriga-\nton waste canals.\n\n\n1t would be new twist to the old\nstory of the Pied Piper of Hame-\nlin. Then those Beatles could\nrave about the way they sent those\ncrazy, wild darling beetles.\n\n\nWonder who could foot the\nBeatles' bill7",
