At\nthe same time, the aerospace\nindustry IL developing very\nhigh-performance aircraft, and\nliRh.speed Vertical Takeoff and\nLanding Craft, with great-vers-\nability, which will become oper-\national before 1912.\n\n\nThough ALA makes no at\ntempt to predict major break\nthroughs in technology, 1t points\nout that the general trends and\nrequirements for the space pro-\ngram over the next 10 years\n\"can be forecast with reason\nable certainty\" And among the\ngeneral trends an q require.\nYnents its forecasts are:\n\n\ny Newly-developed COMPUTE\ners to take over the role Of\ncountdown procedures for space\nflight, which for the most part\nare now dependent on manual\noperations.\n\n\n~ The memory capacity Of\nground-based data processing\nequipment that will increase\nabout 1000, 900 times over the\npresent units.\n\n\n81 The temperature resist\nance Of metal alloys will In\ncrease about 1000 degrees\nTahrenheit-a factor that has\nslowed the development Of high\nperformance aerospace vehicles.\n\n\nThese aspects Of future space\nflights are incorporated In a\nnew publication, The Aerospace\nTechnical Forecast, which was\nprepared by the Aerospace In\ndustries Association. The publ\ncation IL a guide to industry en-\ngineers as well as subcontrac-\ntors a n d suppliers for future\nplanning. Copies Of the report\nare $500 each and are avail\nable at Aerospace Industries\nAssociation, 1925 DeSales st.\nNV, Washington 6, DC.\n\n\nTrends and Requirements\n\n\nThe publication divides the\ntrends and requirements\" into\neight sections: environmenlal,\nsystem, propulsion, materials,\nsystem components, groun d\nsupport equipment, manufacture\ning process and testing.\n\n\nAS for the systems, the Fore\ncast notes there will be a re-\nquirement for ct least 10 times\n90 many major training sys.\nTENS.

This\nmeans that by clustering these\nengines, booster power In the\nrange Of Is to go million pounds\nOf first stage thrust can be\nproduced.
