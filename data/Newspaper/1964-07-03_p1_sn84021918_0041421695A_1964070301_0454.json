The last miles we're\n.rought, the traffic was getting\nheavier and more trucks were\nheading out.\n\n\nStopping at a motel before\nreaching the city. we ate a sand\nwich, bathed and tucked our\nweary sleeves into bed.\n\n\nEarly the next morning we\nstarted again westward and made\nexcellent time to San Francisco.\nThe ocean from the Golden Gate\nBridge appeared hundred miles\ndeep. We we're in slight fog\nand the ships moored made a\ngrand sight.\n\n\nThe hotel where convention\nheadquarters were located was\nacross from San Francisco In\nternational Airport. We drove\npast Candlestick Park to the\nhotel. 1t seems a strange place\nfor a baseball park, but many\nstrange things occur in the Col\nden State.\n\n\nEdward and Iwere among early\narrivals at the Thunderbird\nHotel.
