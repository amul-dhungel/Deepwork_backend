Adjust speed to road con-\nditions. In heavy rain, front\nwheels actually leave road at 80\nm.p.h. and skim on rain film.\nStay on your side. Allow plenty\nof time and distance for passing.\nDon't pass on an intersection,\ncurve, bridge, railroad tracks.\nYield right of way. An intersec-\nton is a danger zone, proceed\nwith caution.\n\n\nIf you're driving, don't drink.\nTwo drinks can blunt refexes.\nAvoid driving under influence of\ndrugs. Effects Of \"pep pills.\"\ntranquilizers, other medicines,\ncan be dangerous behind the\nwheel. Ask your doctor about eff\nfects of remedies prescribed.\nKeep your distance. Allow at least\none car length between you and\ncar ahead for each 10 m.p.h.\nMake exit gracefully. Get in right\nlane early when leaving super\nhighway. Turn into \"speed\nchange\" exit lane without slack\nening speed, then accelerate\nrapidly.\n\n\nUse directional signals. Failure\nto do so may bring a traffic ticket.\nObey traffic signals. Passing of\nSTOP signs is a common acct\ndent cause according to Sentry\nInsurance findings.\n\n\nFinally, check up before starting\nup. Lights, signals, brakes, tires,\nsteering, exhaust system, wipers,\nhorn and rear-view mirrors\nshould be in top condition.",

Sur\nveys show vast majority of\ndrivers think of themselves as\n\"better than average drivers\"\nYet, most traffic accidents are a\nresult of violation of the law or\ncommon-sense rule of safe driv-\ning.\n\n\nSlow down and enjoy your trip.\n\"Speed too fast\" is number one\nkiller. Adjust speed to road con-\nditions. In heavy rain, front\nwheels actually leave road at 80\nm.p.h. and skim on rain film.\nStay on your side. Allow plenty\nof time and distance for passing.\nDon't pass on an intersection,\ncurve, bridge, railroad tracks.\nYield right of way. An intersec-\nton is a danger zone, proceed\nwith caution.\n\n\nIf you're driving, don't drink.\nTwo drinks can blunt refexes.\nAvoid driving under influence of\ndrugs. Effects Of \"pep pills.\"\ntranquilizers, other medicines,\ncan be dangerous behind the\nwheel. Ask your doctor about eff\nfects of remedies prescribed.\nKeep your distance. Allow at least\none car length between you and\ncar ahead for each 10 m.p.h.\nMake exit gracefully. Get in right\nlane early when leaving super\nhighway. Turn into \"speed\nchange\" exit lane without slack\nening speed, then accelerate\nrapidly.\n\n\nUse directional signals. Failure\nto do so may bring a traffic ticket.\nObey traffic signals. Passing of\nSTOP signs is a common acct\ndent cause according to Sentry\nInsurance findings.\n\n\nFinally, check up before starting\nup. Lights, signals, brakes, tires,\nsteering, exhaust system, wipers,\nhorn and rear-view mirrors\nshould be in top condition.",
