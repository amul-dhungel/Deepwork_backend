The king size bed was real\nly an oversize king size. The mat\ntress we had ordered was too\nsmall. 1t was several days before\nthe correct one was delivered.\n\n\nOn the first evening after the\nbedroom furniture was delivered\nIl received the shock of my life\n| found had forgotten to buy\nany king size bed linens. | dashed\nto the telephone and called sew\neral stores. Only one store had\nthe oversize king size sheets l\nwanted.\n\n\nA few minutes before closing\ntime rushed in the store and\nordered two sheets. While look\nIng around, remembered that |\nwould need a king size blanket,\ntoo.\n\n\nThe next day | returned and\npurchased three more sets of\nsheets, two sets of pillowcases,\ntwo large pillows and ordered\na king size mattress cover.\n\n\nThe king size bedspread my\nMother sent US last year came in\nhandy. We will have to find an\ndiversified one after our new drap-\ncries are finished and hung.\n\n\nYou can buy some new fur\nniture, but 1t will cause you to\nalways get something else new.\nA new broom may sweep clean\nlit will sweep a new rug even\ncleaner.\n\n\nThe new bed was the starting\npoint of decorating the entire\nbedroom and buying new linens,\ndraperies and throw rugs.
