My husband said\nhe liked the peace but he missed\nmy dulcet tones. After several\nbright yellow capsules and a nose\nspray, l resumed my good voice\nand now l am pushed trying to\nwind up another week paper with\nmy husband s help. We are doing\nthree things at once.\n\n\nWe have our bags open all over\nthe house, we put in various ar\nticles from time to time. We find\ncopy for the next editions, we\nmake notes for those kind souls\nwho will publish the paper while\nwe are away.\n\n\nSunday was a not so typical\nday. We arose early and the &C\ntivity started with the usual fruit\nJuice, cereal and tea. My hus-\nband was reading the mornings\npaper when he decided we should\nchoose and pack some items\nwe would want.\n\n\nBetween the telephone calls,\nvisits, radio programs, reading\npapers, tipping notes, addressing\ncards, emptying trash, making\nlunch, shining shoes and washing\nclothes - l barely managed to\ndrop into bed an hour after mid\nnight.\n\n\nWednesday, Dec. %, our date\nof departure seems close--how-\never, from the number Of things\nwe must do surely it's more\nthan two days away.",
