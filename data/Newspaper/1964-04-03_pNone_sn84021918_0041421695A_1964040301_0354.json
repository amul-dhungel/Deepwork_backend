A\nbox to play hide-and-seek in or a\ncatnip trinket will delight them.\n\n\nBe sure that your cats toys\ncannot be splintered, torn apart\nand swallowed. Give your cat\nfew toys to begin with and add\nnew ones from time to time. This\nwill keep him from becoming\nbored and destructive.\n\n\nThe Purina Cat Care Center\nsuggests few of the toys which\nyour cat will enjoy:\n\n\ncelluloid ball that rattles.\n\n\ncellophane and catnip bag.\n\n\n\"a spool attached to a strong\n\n\npiece of string and hung from\n\n\na chair or doorknob.\n\n\n\"a rubber mouse that squeaks.\n\n\nBe careful of open drawers,\ntrunks and closets. Cats love to\nplay in and investigate warm,\ndark spots and are often unwit-\ntingly imprisoned.\n\n\nAlso, if you tie ribbon around\nyour cats neck remember that it\ncan be dangerous as ribbons are\neasily caught and pulled tight. If\nyour pet wears a collar outdoors\nfor identification purposes, be\nsure it is large enough to slip\nover the head if necessary.",
