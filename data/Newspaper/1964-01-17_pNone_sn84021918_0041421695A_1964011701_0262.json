They produced menthol\nones. They turned out filter\nones. Some used tiny spirals of\nclean paper, others used web\nfibers--all we're trying to make\ntheir products clinically pure.\n\n\nFilters we're put up front, fill\ntiers we're brown, filters we're\nrecessed, but the final ingred-\nient--tobacco was changed very\nlittle.\n\n\nWhen Carrie Nation and others\nwe're fighting John Barleycorn-\nan insidious little product--a Gig\narctic was putting its way into\nthe American way Of life.
