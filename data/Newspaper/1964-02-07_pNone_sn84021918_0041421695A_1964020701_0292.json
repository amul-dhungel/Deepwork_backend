Zavatt, chief Judge\nof the US District Court, who\nruled on the NAACP suit On Jan.\n\"a. ..-1 -s.,.\n\n\nIn what may prove to be landr\nmark decision, Judge Zavatt up\nheld the NAACP claim that de\nfacto school segregation in Man\nhasset is unc constitutional. School\nboards cannot use the excuse that\nsegregated schools are due to\nneighborhood housing patterns\nand are therefore, not theirrre\nsponsibility, he said.\n\n\nJudge Zavatts decision was\ncarefully spelled out in a 59-page\nstatement which probed deeply\ninto all the facts surrounding the\ncase. School boundary lines in\nManhasset have not been changed\nsince 1929 when the population\nwas predominantly white. Since\nthat time Negro migration into\nthe district had caused one of\nthe three elementary schools,\nthe Valley School, to become \"a\nper cent Negro with total atten-\ndance of l66 pupils.\n\n\nThe other two elementary\nschools, Plandome Road, which\nhas 900 pupils, and Munsey Park,\nwhich has 574, are completely\nwhite.",
